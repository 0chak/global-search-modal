This is usually the domain where your final project will be hosted. Youâ€™ll use this same domain to install locally and in production. Once you have provided a domain, your license key will be activated, and you can proceed with installing with Composer below.

**Tip:** If you missed this step or need to add additional domains for other projects, you can access the activation page by going to Transactions in your AnyStack account and then clicking View details on the Advanced Tables product.

{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "composer",
            "url": "https://.composer.sh"
        }
    ]

```

```bash
    composer require charrafimed/global-search-modal

During installation, you will be prompted to enter your username and password:

```

Username: [license-email]
Password: [license-key]

```

Your username is your email address, and the password should be your license key followed by a colon (:), and then the domain you are activating. For example, if your details are:

- License key: 8c21dfde-6273-4932-b4ba-8bcc723efced

Username: your_email@gmail.com
Password: 8c21dfde-6273-4932-b4ba-8bcc723efced:your_domain.com

Ensure that the license key and domain fingerprint are separated by a colon (:).

**Tip**: If you encounter a 402 error, it's likely because the colon and domain fingerprint were not included correctly.

### modal position 
The Global Search Modal Plugin allows you to customize the modal's position using the `position` method. You can define the position of the modal by specifying the top, right, left, bottom values. The method supports two formats for specifying the position: numeric values with units and strings with units.

#### Example: Customizing the Position

To customize the modal's position, use the `position` method within the `GlobalSearchModalPlugin` instance. You can specify the top and bottom values using the `top` and `right` methods, respectively. The two supported formats are:
1. **Numeric Values with Units**: Specify the position using a numeric value followed by a unit (e.g., `100, 'px'`).
2. **String with Units**: Specify the position directly as a string (e.g., `"30px"`).
#### Usage Example

Here is an example of how to customize the modal's position:
```php
    public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel->plugins([
        GlobalSearchModalPlugin::make()
            ->position(
                fn (Position $position) => $position
                    ->top(100, 'px')     // Numeric value with unit
                    ->right('30rem')     // String with unit
            )
    ]);
}
```
Both formats are supported, and you can use them interchangeably based on your preference.

**Tip**: This method uses native CSS styling, so you can use any CSS unit with any float value.

## highlight : 
You can enable or disable the highlighting of query matches using the `->highlighter()` method. By default, highlighting is enabled.
```php
use CharrafiMed\GlobalSearchModal\GlobalSearchModalPlugin;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        ->plugins([
            GlobalSearchModalPlugin::make()
                ->highlighter(false) // disable highlighting
        ]);
}
```
### Passing Styles
To customize the styles for the highlighted text, you can use the highlightQueryStyles method. This method accepts a string or an array of styles.

#### Example With Array:
```php
use CharrafiMed\GlobalSearchModal\GlobalSearchModalPlugin;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        ->plugins([
            GlobalSearchModalPlugin::make()
                ->highlightQueryStyles([
                    'background-color' => 'yellow',
                    'font-weight' => 'bold',
                ])
        ]);
}
```
#### Example With Raw String:

```php
use CharrafiMed\GlobalSearchModal\GlobalSearchModalPlugin;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        ->plugins([
            GlobalSearchModalPlugin::make()
                    ->highlightQueryStyles('background-color: yellow; font-weight: bold;') // Custom styles

        ]);
}
```
