## Activating Your License on AnyStack
 AnyStack to handle payment, licensing, and distribution for this global search modal .

During the purchasing process, AnyStack will provide you with a license key. You will also be asked by AnyStack to activate your license by providing a domain. This is usually the domain where your final project will be hosted. Youâ€™ll use this same domain to install locally and in production. Once you have provided a domain, your license key will be activated, and you can proceed with installing with Composer below.

**Tip:** If you missed this step or need to add additional domains for other projects, you can access the activation page by going to Transactions in your AnyStack account and then clicking View details on the Advanced Tables product.

**Tip:** You will need both your license key and your domain to authenticate when you install the package with Composer.

## Installing with Composer

To install Global Search Modal , add the package to your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "composer",
            "url": "https://.composer.sh"
        }
    ]
}

```
Once the repository has been added to your composer.json file, you can install global search modal like any other composer package using the composer require command

```bash
    composer require charrafimed/global-search-modal
```

During installation, you will be prompted to enter your username and password:

```
Loading composer repositories with package information
Authentication required (global-search-modal.composer.sh):
Username: [license-email]
Password: [license-key]

```

Your username is your email address, and the password should be your license key followed by a colon (:), and then the domain you are activating. For example, if your details are:
- Contact email: your_email@gmail.com
- License key: 8c21dfde-6273-4932-b4ba-8bcc723efced
- Activation fingerprint: your_domain.com


You should enter the following when prompted:

```
Loading composer repositories with package information
Authentication required (global-search-modal.composer.sh):
Username: your_email@gmail.com
Password: 8c21dfde-6273-4932-b4ba-8bcc723efced:your_domain.com
```

Ensure that the license key and domain fingerprint are separated by a colon (:).

**Tip**: If you encounter a 402 error, it's likely because the colon and domain fingerprint were not included correctly.
