## Activating Your License on AnyStack
 AnyStack to handle payment, licensing, and distribution for this global search modal .

During the purchasing process, AnyStack will provide you with a license key. You will also be asked by AnyStack to activate your license by providing a domain. This is usually the domain where your final project will be hosted. Youâ€™ll use this same domain to install locally and in production. Once you have provided a domain, your license key will be activated, and you can proceed with installing with Composer below.

**Tip:** If you missed this step or need to add additional domains for other projects, you can access the activation page by going to Transactions in your AnyStack account and then clicking View details on the Advanced Tables product.

**Tip:** You will need both your license key and your domain to authenticate when you install the package with Composer.
